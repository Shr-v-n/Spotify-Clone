      You're the one that I need in my life
      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I see as my wife

      I remember the first time I saw you
      I knew that I had to pursue you
      Your eyes they shine like the stars in the sky
      I promise I'll never say goodbye

      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I need in my life
      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I see as my wife

      Every moment I spend with you's precious
      Without you my world would be senseless
      I'll hold you close through the dark and the light
      Together we'll make everything right

      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I need in my life
      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I see as my wife

      Through the storms and the sunshine we'll weather
      I'll love you now and forever
      My heart is yours, it will never depart
      You've captured the core of my heart

      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I need in my life
      Habibi, habibi
      You're the one that I see as my wife`,

      I'm on the outside
      I'm looking in
      I'm on the outside
      And I've been cold

      I've been frozen
      I've been closed off
      I've been broken
      I've been so lost
      And I've been cold

      I'm trying to find my way back home
      But I don't know where home is anymore
      I'm searching for something real
      Something that I can feel
      But all I find is this cold

      I've built these walls up high
      So no one sees me cry
      I keep my pain inside
      Where no one can find
      I'm cold, so cold

      I need a fire to melt this ice
      Something to make me feel alive
      I'm tired of being so alone
      I need to find my way back home

      I've been frozen
      I've been closed off
      I've been broken
      I've been so lost
      And I've been cold

      But I'm breaking free from these chains
      I won't be frozen in this place
      I'll find the warmth I need inside
      No longer will I run and hide

      I'm thawing out, I'm feeling heat
      I'm standing strong back on my feet
      The cold is gone, I'm finally free
      The real me is who I'll be`,

      Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
      Everything she never had she's showing off
      Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
      She's heading for something that she won't forget
      Having no regrets is all that she really wants

      We're only getting older, baby
      And I've been thinking about it lately
      Does it ever drive you crazy
      Just how fast the night changes?
      Everything that you've ever dreamed of
      Disappearing when you wake up
      But there's nothing to be afraid of
      Even when the night changes
      It will never change me and you

      Chasing it tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
      He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
      Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop
      Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
      She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
      Having no regrets is all that she really wants

      We're only getting older, baby
      And I've been thinking about it lately
      Does it ever drive you crazy
      Just how fast the night changes?
      Everything that you've ever dreamed of
      Disappearing when you wake up
      But there's nothing to be afraid of
      Even when the night changes
      It will never change me and you

      Going out tonight, changes into something red
      Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
      Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

      We're only getting older, baby
      And I've been thinking about it lately
      Does it ever drive you crazy
      Just how fast the night changes?

All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose

And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love

Do you have room for me inside of your head?

I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect

I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son

I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kind of short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine
And I promise that one day I'll feel alright

I think my time is coming, I feel it in my bones
I'm getting colder, lying here alone
The sheets are getting heavier, I can feel them on my skin
I'm holding on to memories again

I'm holding on to you, don't wanna say goodbye
I wish that I could stay, I wish I didn't have to die
There's so much I should say, but I'm too tired to speak
I'll just lie here quietly, listen to you breathe

I see my mother crying, I see my father too
I see my girlfriend trying, she don't know what to do
I see the doctor shaking his head, he gives me just a week
I close my eyes and drift away, into eternal sleep

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine

Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso

Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam bam

Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten "¡ay, bendito!"
Para que mi sello se quede contigo

    lyrics: `Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble
Big trouble, and if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances

You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton, no, Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head
A zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my ramen noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble
Enough to make you dribble some proof of my pigeon holes
That I'm not lyin', and that is the message
Which brings us back to the original thesis
Don't try to battle me, at least not commercially`,

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, wait
Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, who's that dude? I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
When you're with 'em?
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills
Used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em?
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom
And these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both, so they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over
But you promised her next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you
Baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie`,

    lyrics: `May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement
Ha ha! Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though"

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Ah!)

I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat these albums like Valiums
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

    lyrics: `'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bone collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Trying to hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again

So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry, I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does offend me

I'm wondering what I gotta do to get in through your skin
'Cause nobody's paying attention to where I've been
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs in the studio
But you don't hear a thing, you just ask for more

So here I go, it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bone collapse

Last week, I was walking through the hallway
I heard a couple rappers talking, one said to the other
"Man, I heard he's about to lose it, he's going crazy"
I'm like, "Yeah? So? What the fuck is that to me?"

I'm a maniac, you would be too if you saw the shit I see
I'm like a schizophrenic, I hear voices constantly
Telling me to kill you, but I would never do it
Unless I was high on PCP, and even then, I probably wouldn't do it

I'm just playin', ladies, you know I love you
But I'm a man of my word, and I said I'd do it, so I gotta do it
I'm in the zone right now, I'm feeling like I'm invincible
Like nothing can stop me, I'm unstoppable

I'm a soldier, I'm a warrior, I'm a fighter
I'm a writer, I'm a rhymer, I'm a mic igniter
I'm a lyrical terrorist, I'm a verbal assassin
I'm a walking disaster, I'm a walking catastrophe

So if you're gonna step to me, you better come correct
'Cause I'm the best thing walking, and I ain't talking 'bout sex
I'm talking 'bout skills, I'm talking 'bout talent
I'm talking 'bout being the best that ever did it, period

So 'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bone collapse`,

Wave your hands in the air, shake your derriere
These good times only come once in a lifetime

You see the sunlight creep in the glass
And we're still going strong
Yeah, like you said, last all night long
Just like we wrote the song
So let the beat rock on

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow
